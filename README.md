<h1 align="center">MYFLIX</h1>

<p>This project is created with React and handcrafted from scratch, without the use of a boilerplate or third-party library. It is based on the Netflix website in style, using TheMovieDatabase API to create a homepage with three carousels of movies: top rated, upcoming and most popular.</p> 

<p>Each carousel contains a number of movies which, when clicked, take the user to a single movie page with movie details and a 'favourite' section. The individual movie pages have a different font style and colour, depending on the carousel that they are associated with.</p>
